1. Current code probably implements GumTree algorithm (have to check again)
2. Working on JDT ASTNode. Should be made to work with Boa AST (so, have to enable visit structure in Boa AST if not present.)
3. For Python, can make it work for dltk ASTNode, however, it has to be done at data generation step then.
